Hi! I'm Kim!

My heart is forever young and I love mischief-making--and sparkles.

I grew up in Iowa where sunsets over cornfields are beautiful and underrated. I went to the University of Iowa, studied music and became passionate about life.

After leaving my job at a [creative agency][0], I began focusing on my love for volunteering, community development and the [environment][1].

_I'm on an adventure to live every day as fully as possible. _

I believe that we are all walking books, full of beautiful stories and interconnectedness.

So [tell me yours][2], it might make a beautiful painting.
